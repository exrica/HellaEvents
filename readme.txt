What can I do as a guest (unregistered/signed out)?
---------------------------------------------------

- Guests can view the upcoming and past events by clicking on the Upcoming or Past Events links, however the location of the event is hidden.  Only the event name, date, time, and rsvp numbers are shown.

- Guests can click on an event to see its details, but the location is still hidden.

- Guests can view the calendar and see events listed on their day of the month.

- Guests can click the Members button, but cannot see members until they are signed in.



What can I do as a member?
--------------------------

Members can access everything that guests can access, plus the following:

- The upcoming, past, and event detail pages now show the location of the event.

- Members can RSVP on the event detail page.  Members can also undo their RSVP to make changes.

- Members can comment on events. 

- Members can view the members list, and click on members to view their profile.

- Members can view and update their own profile.

- Members can change their password.



What can I do as an event coordinator?
--------------------------------------

Event Coordinators can access everything that members can, plus the following:

- Event coordinators can create new events by clicking on the Add Event button. Note: There must be venues (locations) set up in the system before events can be added.  Administrators can add locations.

- Event coordinators can edit upcoming events by clicking on the edit event button on the upcoming event list.

- Event coordinators can cancel/delete upcoming and past events.  This will remove all RSVPs and comments related to the event.

- Event coordinators can remove the RSVPs of other members from events.  This deletes the RSVP completely and members must re-RSVP if they want to attend.

- When viewing an event page or profile page, event coordinators can see users real names (if set by the user).



What can I do as an admin?
--------------------------

Admins can access everything that Event Coordinators can, plus the following:

- Admins can add new locations by clicking the Manage Locations button, then clicking the Add New Location button on that page.

- Locations cannot be deleted, but they can be deactivated to prevent new events from using locations that shouldn't be used.  Admins can deactivate and reactivate by clicking the Deactivate Location or Reactivate Location button (found on the location's row on the Manage Locations page).

- Admins can edit member roles by clicking the Edit Member Role button (on the member page or on the profile page).  Admins can set a member's role to be member or event coordinator.  Admins cannot edit their own role or the role of other Admins.

- Admins can ban members and event coordinators by clicking the Ban Member checkbox on the edit member role page.  When a member is banned they lose their previous role.



What can I do as a Super User?
------------------------------

This account role was created for the purpose of promoting members to the admin role (so that admins can't go on a banning spree and take over the site).  It has access to all the privileges for the above roles, but should only be used for the purpose mentioned here.


What happens to a banned member?
--------------------------------

Banning a member essentially reverts them to guest privileges.  Banned members cannot RSVP to events, comment on events, or view members/profiles.
